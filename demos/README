An overview of the demo options is given in the file DemoContents


To run the demos: 

1) make sure the golem95 library has been installed correctly using
     ./configure [options]
     make
     make install
   from the main directory.

   If you want to run demos/demo_LT, which is a Fortran 77 program,
   make sure you have specified the correct options in running
   configure. Either specify the Fortran compiler as both the
   Fortran 90 and the Fortran 77 compiler.

      ./configure [other-options] FC=gfortran F77=gfortran

   It is also possible to choose the compilers differently
   but linking becomes more involved and goes beyond the
   scope of this README file.

2) chdir to demos and type 'make' if you want to compile all demos
   or add the name of the demo file if you want to run only one
   demo file, e.g. 'make demo_4point'.

   You can choose N-point functions for N=3,4,5 or 6, 
   or calculate 4-photon helicity amplitudes,
   or do some tests in a region where a kinematic determinant becomes small.
   A list of all demo options is given in the file DemoContents.

3) if you chose to calculate an N-point form factor,
   you will be asked to give the rank of the integral resp. 
   form factor you would like to calculate
   
   NOTE: 
   For the demo programs, 
   the numerical points have been fixed to some arbitrarily 
   chosen value.
   If the rank is nonzero, the program will pick a certain
   Feynman parameter configuration for the numerator.
   If you would like to choose a different configuration, 
   you should either change the corresponding file 
   demo_Npoint.f90 
   or 
   go to the directory "test", 
   where you can choose the Feynman parameters in the numerator
   and define the numerical point via an input file.
   
   We should mention that if the momentum squared p_i^2 of an external leg 
   of an integral is of the order of machine precision, we set p^2 to zero.
   Thus, when using quadruple precision, this cutoff is different from 
   the one in double precision.
   Therefore, if using demo_6point.f90 in quadruple precision, 
   p_i^2 of the order of 10^-16 will be treated as off-shell legs
   and thus the result will be different if the input momenta are 
   unchanged, i.e. light-like in double precision only.
  
4) The results of the demo files are listed in the files called
      "table_of_results*.txt" and "demo*.txt".
       They allow the user to verify that his installation is running correctly.
